# Budget Calculator
Front-end Angular Application.

In this project, I created the budget calculator that is a CRUD front-end web application using Angular framework. This application allows users to add new budget items and then those items will be displayed in the income or expenses column base on the amount that the users input. The users are able to edit by clicking on the budget items. A dialog will appear, and this dialog allows the users to edit the values of the budget item. Furthermore,  the users can delete items by hovering over them and clicking on the delete button. The total budget will be calculated and displayed on the screen when the users add, update or delete items.

This application contains CRUD features such as:
- Add budget items
- List budget items
- Update/edit budget items
- Delete budget items

After finishing this application, I have learned:
- How to create a CRUD front-end application with Angular.
- How to design the UI for the application by using Bulma modern CSS framework.
- How to use a variety of Angular techniques such as:
  -   Modules
  -   Component: templates and views, data binding, and directives.
  -   Services and dependency injection.
